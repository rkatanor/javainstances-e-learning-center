JDK:  

JDK is an implementation of either one of the JAVA SE or JAVA EE or JAVA ME platforms released by Oracle Corporation in the form of binary product aimed at java developers.

JDK includes a private JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and few other resources to finish the development of java applications.

On 2006 SUN announced that they would release it under GPL (General Public Licence) thus making it as a free software.

Apart from SUN/Oracle JDK , we do have JDKâ€™s from other vendors like IBM, AZUL Systems,Apache etc.  All adhere to basic java specifications but differ in some areas in terms of Garbage Collection, Compilation Strategies etc..
